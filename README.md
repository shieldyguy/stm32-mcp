# stm32-mcp

MCP server that lets Claude Code build, flash, and communicate with STM32 hardware.

stm32-mcp is pretty specific to how I tend to approach hardware development, but it is likely useful to others, too! It could be massaged to fit lots of workflows, but this is laser focused on mine (stlink-v3 mini, VCP on that header, STM32 microcontroller). 

You can do things like:

> **me:** hey who is plugged in right now?
>
> **claude:** two unnamed probes connected to two unnamed PCBs
>
> **me:** k ask them who they are and give them a nickname based on their response 
>
> **claude:** got it, do you want to nickname the probes too? your boards are 'doorbell A' and 'synthesizer B'
>
> **me:** yep, I put paint marker on those probes. call doorbell's 'blue' and the synth's 'red'
>
> **claude:** done. what's next?
>
> **me:** give them both VCP commands so they can talk to each other, then have the doorbell ask the synth on a date
>
> **claude:** *thinking...* done, synth declined. plenty of fish in the sea, doorbell!

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard that lets AI assistants like Claude use external tools. This server gives Claude the ability to compile your firmware, flash it to a board, talk to it over serial, and read memory via SWD. It is flexible and conversational. 

> [!WARNING]
> This server gives an AI direct access to your compiler, debug probe, and serial ports. It can flash firmware, overwrite memory, and send arbitrary data to your hardware. This is powerful and useful, but it is not a sandbox. Know what's connected before you let it rip.

## Prerequisites

- **STM32CubeIDE** installed at `/Applications/STM32CubeIDE.app` (macOS) or `/opt/st/stm32cubeide_*` (Linux)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenOCD** (`brew install open-ocd`) — for flash, memory read/write, and live monitoring
- **open-source stlink tools** (`brew install stlink`) — for probe enumeration
- **ST-Link** connected via USB (for flash/board info)
- **Serial port** available (ST-Link VCP or USB-UART adapter)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shieldyguy/stm32-mcp.git
cd stm32-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Register with Claude Code

### Option A: CLI

```bash
claude mcp add stm32 -- /path/to/stm32-mcp/.venv/bin/python -m stm32_mcp.server
```

### Option B: Project config

Add to your project's `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stm32": {
      "command": "/path/to/stm32-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "stm32_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Self-serve CLI 

`bin/` contains four thin wrappers over the same code the MCP
tools use

| Command       | Usage                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `stm32-list`  | List connected probes + boards with nicknames                |
| `stm32-flash` | `stm32-flash <probe\|board> <file.elf> [--noverify] [--noreset]` |
| `stm32-build` | `stm32-build <project_path> [Debug\|Release] [--clean]`      |
| `stm32-bf`    | `stm32-bf <project_path> <probe\|board> [Debug\|Release] [--clean]` |
| `stm32-help`  | List these commands with their usage (auto-generated from the scripts) |

Add `bin/` to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/stm32-mcp/bin:$PATH"
```

Probe nicknames and board nicknames resolve.

Builds share the MCP's headless CubeIDE workspace lock, so a
`stm32-build`/`stm32-bf` racing an agent-driven build will queue behind it.


## Available Tools

### Build & Flash

| Tool                    | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `stm32_build`           | Compile firmware using CubeIDE headless builder        |
| `stm32_flash`           | Flash .elf/.bin/.hex to board via ST-Link SWD          |
| `stm32_build_and_flash` | Build + flash in one step (the 90% case)               |
| `stm32_board_info`      | Read ST-Link/MCU info (device ID, flash size, voltage) |

### Multi-Board Management

| Tool                 | Description                                          |

## Hardware Sequences

`serial_sequence` runs multiple steps — serial send, delay, webcam capture, and SWD memory read/write — in a single tool call with real timing between steps. No tool-call overhead between steps; delays use a real `time.sleep()` in the executor thread. This is critical for timing-sensitive hardware test sequences and for bit-banging registers over SWD (e.g. blinking a GPIO on a board with no firmware).

### Step types

```json
[
  { "send": "SIM_LEFT", "to": "/dev/cu.usbmodem11202" },
  { "delay_ms": 500 },
  {
    "send": "GET_BLINK_STATE",
    "to": "/dev/cu.usbmodem11402",
    "expect": "BLINK"
  },
  { "capture": true, "label": "post_brake" },
  {
    "mem_write": true,
    "address": "0x48000418",
    "value": "0x40",
    "probe": "yellow"
  },
  { "delay_ms": 1000 },
  {
    "mem_read": true,
    "address": "0x48000400",
    "count": 2,
    "probe": "yellow",
    "label": "gpio_post"
  }
]
```

- **Send step:** `{send, to, expect?, read_timeout?, line_ending?}` — `to` is the port path from `serial_connect`
- **Delay step:** `{delay_ms}` — real `time.sleep()`, not tool-call round-trips
- **Capture step:** `{capture: true, label?, device_index?}` — PNG saved to `/tmp/stm32-captures/`
- **Memory write step:** `{mem_write: true, address | symbol + elf_path, value, probe, width?}`
- **Memory read step:** `{mem_read: true, address | symbol + elf_path, probe, count?, width?, label?}`

Memory step notes:

- `probe` accepts ST-Link SN, probe nickname, or board nickname
- `address` is hex (e.g. `"0x48000418"`); alternatively use `symbol` + `elf_path` to resolve by name
- `width` is 8/16/32 bits, defaults to 32 (auto-detected from symbol size when using `symbol`)
- Each memory op currently launches a fresh OpenOCD process (~tens of ms overhead per op), so inter-memory-op timing below ~50ms is approximate. Delays themselves are accurate.

### Parameters

- **`on_failure`:** `"continue"` (default) runs all steps regardless. `"stop"` aborts on first failure.
- **`filter_responses`:** When `true`, `expect` patterns match only `>`-prefixed VCP response lines (ignores debug noise).

### Output

```
Step 1 [/dev/cu.usbmodem11202] SEND: SIM_LEFT
  Response: >OK:SIM_LEFT

Step 2 DELAY: 500ms

Step 3 [/dev/cu.usbmodem11402] SEND: GET_BLINK_STATE
  Response: >BLINK_STATE:BLINK
  Expect "BLINK": PASS

Step 4 [yellow] MEM_WRITE: Wrote 0x00000040 to 0x48000418

Step 5 DELAY: 1000ms

Step 6 [yellow] MEM_READ: gpio_post 0x48000400: 0xabffdfff 0x00000080

Summary: 2/2 sends OK, 1/1 assertions PASS, 1/1 mem_writes OK, 1/1 mem_reads OK
```

## Live Memory Monitoring

Monitor firmware variables in real time via SWD, without modifying firmware or using serial. OpenOCD runs as a persistent subprocess and polls variables over its built-in TCL socket.

### Start a session

```
live_memory_start(
    variables='["blink", "ts"]',       # symbol names from ELF
    elf_path="/path/to/firmware.elf",
    probe="taillight",                  # board/probe nickname
    interval_ms=500                     # min 250ms
)
```

Variables can be:

- **Symbol names** (strings): `"blink"` — resolved from the ELF via `arm-none-eabi-nm`
- **Dicts with symbol + type**: `{"symbol": "temperature", "type": "float"}` — interprets 32-bit value as IEEE 754
- **Dicts with raw address**: `{"address": "0x20000304", "name": "x", "width": 32}`

### Read recent values

```
live_memory_read(session_id="abc123", last_n=10)
```

Returns recent entries from an in-memory ring buffer (max 100 entries). Full history is written to the JSONL output file.

### JSONL output format

```json
{ "t": 1709830123.456, "elapsed_s": 1.002, "values": { "blink": 65539 } }
```

### Stop a session

```
live_memory_stop(session_id="abc123")
```

Returns stats: duration, read count, error count, output file path.

### Constraints

- **One session per probe** — this is a hardware constraint (single SWD connection)
- **Stop before flashing** — `live_memory` holds the SWD connection; `stm32_flash` and `stm32_read/write_memory` will fail if a session is active
- **TCL port 6666** — OpenOCD's default. Stop other OpenOCD instances first if there's a conflict

## Serial Defaults

- **Baud rate:** 115200
- **Line ending:** LF (`\n`)
- **Read polling:** 50ms inter-byte sleep, 200ms silence break
- **Buffer limits:** 4096 bytes max read

## Development

### MCP Inspector

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
mcp dev src/stm32_mcp/server.py
```

### Loopback Testing

Serial tools can be tested without hardware using pyserial's loopback:

```python
import serial
ser = serial.serial_for_url("loop://", baudrate=115200, timeout=0.1)
ser.write(b"PING\n")
print(ser.read(100))  # b'PING\n'
```
